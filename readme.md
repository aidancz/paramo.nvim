paramo.nvim provides several types of paragraph motions:

- para0
- para1
- para2
- para3
- para3a
- para4

ðŸ’– paramo.nvim loves **wrapped lines**

ðŸ˜Š paramo.nvim loves **virtualedit=all** even more

# demo

a paragraph is a sequence of lines

i refer to the first line as the "head" and the last line as the "tail"

this plugin makes it easy to navigate to "head" and "tail"

in the image below, i use continuous blue or yellow to mark the paragraphs that the specific paramo considers

## para0

![](assets/para0.png)

para0 treats a logical line as a paragraph, where a logical line may span multiple screen lines (when `:set wrap`)

## para1

![](assets/para1-1.png)

para1 treats a sequence of **non-empty** lines as a paragraph with this config:

```
{
	empty = false
}
```

![](assets/para1-2.png)

para1 treats a sequence of **empty** lines as a paragraph with this config:

```
{
	empty = true
}
```

## para2

![](assets/para2-1.png)

![](assets/para2-2.png)

![](assets/para2-3.png)

para2 treats a sequence of lines **containing** characters in the **cursor's column** as a paragraph with this config:

```
{
	empty = false
}
```

so the definition of para2 changes depending on the position of the cursor (note the position of the cursor in the image)

to understand the concept of para2, you may want to `:set cursorcolumn` and `:set virtualedit=all`

para2 treats a sequence of lines **not containing** characters in the **cursor's column** as a paragraph with this config:

```
{
	empty = true
}
```

## para3

para3 treats lines with the same indent as the current line as one paragraph

you can adjust the behavior by changing the config

for example:

---

![](assets/para3-00.png)

config:

```
{
	include_more_indent = false,
	include_empty_lines = false,
}
```

---

![](assets/para3-01.png)

config:

```
{
	include_more_indent = false,
	include_empty_lines = true,
}
```

---

![](assets/para3-10.png)

config:

```
{
	include_more_indent = true,
	include_empty_lines = false,
}
```

---

![](assets/para3-11.png)

config:

```
{
	include_more_indent = true,
	include_empty_lines = true,
}
```

## para3a

![](assets/para3a.png)

para3a allows navigation across different indent levels and can be configured by:

```
{
	indent = "eq",
}
```

possible values:

```
	indent = "eq", -- equal indent to current
	indent = "gt", -- greater indent than current
	indent = "lt", -- less indent than current
	indent = "neq", -- not eq
	indent = "ngt", -- not gt
	indent = "nlt", -- not lt
	indent = "any", -- any indent
```

## para4

para4 treats lines with the same first non-blank character as one paragraph

i use para4 to create comment textobject

# setup

## setup example 1:

```
require("paramo").setup({
	{
		type = "para1",
		type_config = {
			empty = false,
		},
		backward = {
			head = "<a-b>",
			tail = "<a-g>",
			head_or_tail = "<a-p>",
		},
		forward = {
			head = "<a-w>",
			tail = "<a-e>",
			head_or_tail = "<a-n>",
		},
	},
})
```

## setup example 2:

you can simulate the builtin `{` and `}` motions with:

```
require("paramo").setup({
	{
		type = "para1",
		type_config = {
			empty = true,
		},
		backward = {
			tail = "{",
		},
		forward = {
			head = "}",
		},
	},
})
```

## setup example 3:

```
require("paramo").setup({
	{
		type = "para0",
		backward = {
			head_or_tail = "<a-k>",
		},
		forward = {
			head_or_tail = "<a-j>",
		},
	},
	{
		type = "para3",
		type_config = {
			include_more_indent = false,
			include_empty_lines = false,
		},
		forward = {
			head = "<down>"
		},
	},
})
```

# textobjects

paramo.nvim does not have any textobjects built in

however, you can use the api together with other textobjects plugins to get the desired textobjects

for example, [mini.ai](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-ai.md):

```
i = function(ai_type)
	local head_and_tail
	if ai_type == "i" then
		head_and_tail =
			require("paramo").get_head_and_tail(
				"para3",
				{
					include_more_indent = false,
					include_empty_lines = false,
				}
			)
	else
		head_and_tail =
			require("paramo").get_head_and_tail(
				"para3",
				{
					include_more_indent = false,
					include_empty_lines = true,
				}
			)
	end
	return {
		from = {
			line = head_and_tail.head,
			col = 1,
		},
		to = {
			line = head_and_tail.tail,
			col = 1,
		},
		vis_mode = "V",
	}
end,
```
